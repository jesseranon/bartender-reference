## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This site uses cocktailDB API calls to get information for drinks and displays options in an easy-to-access format. The bartender can then click any option to display the recipe and instructions for how to make the drink.

## Lessons Learned:

Design decisions definitely affect the aesthetics and useability of an app. This app originally displayed results in a carousel instead of a list.  This made the results a lot more difficult to access, as the emphasis was on the carousel itself, rather than having access to a list of options to make a choice.

Being able to choose a search filter increases versatility in the right situations. Customers may not know right away the name of a drink they want and instead might know what type of alcohol they want to go into their drink.

Pulling the necessary information and displaying it in a readable format (recipe cards) is also an important design decision.
